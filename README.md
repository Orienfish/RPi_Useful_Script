# Raspberry Pi Useful Scripts

This repo contains some useful scripts on RPi, including performance monitoring, setting and how to use bluetooth as well as Wi-Fi on RPi. All the code are tested on RPi 3B.

## Performance Monitoring and Setting

As a powerful system running Linux-like OS, RPi is different from other micro-controller platforms running RTOS. The performance-related monitoring and setting operations on RPi do not require reading low-level code or setting register values. Instead, **scripts reading/setting certain files (everything on Linux is a file!) and some helpful tools (e.g. perf, wondershaper) will be enough!**

If you are interested in working with the following performance metrics on Linux, this is the right place for you!

### CPU Frequency

### CPU Utilization

### CPU Temperature

### Performance Counters

### Bandwidth

## Bluetooth on RPi

## Wi-Fi on RPi
